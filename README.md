<h1>A Godot dialog system that converts your story into a JSON file.</h1>

<h5>CURRENTLY SUPPORTING GODOT 4+</h5>

<h3>👋 Quick Start</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open the project.gd file.</li>
  <li>Run the project!</li>
</ol>

<h3>🗒️ Syntax</h3>
<h6>These syntaxes don't mean anything unless you code it in the game build. You can change syntax highlighting/colour in CodeEdit.tscn.</h6>
<ul>
  <li><code>| {insert emoji name} |</code></li>
  <li><code><< {insert character expression name} >></code></li>
  <li><code>!! {insert signal to be emitted} !!</code></li>
  <li><code>+({add this to variables}) / -({delete this from variables})</code></li>
  <li><code>+ {add this to inventory} + / - {remove this from inventory} -</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>🐛 Existing Bugs</h3>
1. Deleting consecutively nodes can confuse the editor and cause problems when you want to open the file next time.
2. Syntax colours sometimes mess up.
3. Sometimes connections to link properly (especially when opening old files).
4. Crashes when creating a new file/opening an old file when another file is already open.
